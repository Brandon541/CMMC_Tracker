## Next Steps for Production

1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory data with a proper database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and role-based access control
3. **API Development**: Create REST API endpoints for data management
4. **Data Persistence**: Implement proper data storage for controls, POA&Ms, and artifacts
5. **Reporting**: Add PDF report generation capabilities
6. **Integration**: Connect with existing security tools and CMMC assessment platforms
7. **Backup**: Implement regular data backup procedures
8. **Security**: Add input validation, CSRF protection, and other security measures

## CMMC Level 2 Control Domains

The application tracks controls across these domains:
- **AC**: Access Control
- **AT**: Awareness and Training
- **AU**: Audit and Accountability
- **CM**: Configuration Management
- **IA**: Identification and Authentication
- **IR**: Incident Response
- **MA**: Maintenance
